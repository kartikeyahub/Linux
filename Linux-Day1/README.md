# Handout: Introduction to Linux

## What is Linux?

### Core Concept
Linux is an open-source operating system kernel. The kernel is the core program that manages the computer's hardware (CPU, memory, devices) and allows software to run.

### What we call "Linux"
When people say "Linux," they usually mean a **Linux distribution** (or "distro"). This is the Linux kernel bundled with other software like system libraries, graphical desktops, and application programs (e.g., web browsers, office suites). Popular distros include Ubuntu, Fedora, and Debian.

### Open Source
The source code for Linux is freely available for anyone to view, modify, and distribute. This encourages collaboration and rapid innovation.

### Creator
The Linux kernel was created by **Linus Torvalds** in 1991.

## Everyday Use of Linux
You might use Linux every day without even knowing it!

- **Servers**: The vast majority of web servers, cloud infrastructure (like AWS and Google Cloud), and supercomputers run on Linux due to its stability, security, and efficiency.

- **Android**: The Android mobile operating system is built on top of the Linux kernel.

- **Embedded Systems**: Runs on devices like smart TVs, routers, smartwatches, and car entertainment systems.

- **Developers & Programmers**: A preferred environment for development because of powerful built-in command-line tools and compatibility with programming languages.

- **Desktop Computing**: User-friendly distros like Ubuntu and Linux Mint offer a complete alternative to Windows or macOS for browsing, office work, and creative projects.

## Unix vs. Linux

| Feature | Unix | Linux |
|---------|------|-------|
| **Origin** | Developed in the 1970s at AT&T Bell Labs. | Inspired by Unix, created in 1991 by Linus Torvalds. |
| **Philosophy** | "Everything is a file." | Follows the same Unix philosophy. |
| **Cost** | Historically proprietary and expensive. Some versions are free (e.g., BSD). | Free and Open Source. You can download and use it without cost. |
| **Development** | Developed by specific companies (e.g., Oracle Solaris, IBM AIX). | Developed collaboratively by a global community of developers. |
| **Hardware** | Originally designed for specific, often high-end, hardware. | Highly portable and runs on a huge variety of hardware, from phones to supercomputers. |
| **Kernel** | Monolithic kernel. | Monolithic kernel. |
| **Variants** | Different "flavors" from different vendors (Solaris, HP-UX, AIX). | Different distributions from different communities/companies (Ubuntu, Red Hat, Arch). |
